Title:
Fix Google Drive upload for Shared Drive backups (supportsAllDrives)

Prompt:

We already have a working automated DB backup system that:

- Creates a .sql.gz backup using pg_dump
- Logs backups into the `backups` table
- Sends email notifications
- Reads `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` from env
- Uses a Google service account from `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
- Targets the folder ID: a folder inside a Shared Drive ("Simtree DB Backups" → "daily-db-backups")

Backups are failing with:
- "Service Accounts do not have storage quota"
- "File not found: <folderId>"

Root cause:
Google Drive API requires `supportsAllDrives: true` (and proper shared drive support) when using a Shared Drive or its folders with a service account.

⚠️ IMPORTANT RULE:
Do NOT change or break any existing logic, jobs, routes, migrations, or configs. Only make the minimal, safe adjustments needed to make uploads work with the existing Shared Drive + folder ID configuration.

### Tasks

1. Locate the Drive upload implementation:
   - The helper/service that calls `drive.files.create(...)` using `googleapis`.
   - It should already be using `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` as the parent folder.

2. Update the Google Drive API calls to fully support Shared Drives:
   - For `drive.files.create(...)`, add:
     - `supportsAllDrives: true`
   - If there is any `drive.files.list(...)` used for retention/cleanup, update it to:
     - `supportsAllDrives: true`
     - `includeItemsFromAllDrives: true`
   - If needed, ensure the auth client is reused and nothing else in the logic is changed.

3. Do NOT:
   - Do not change env var names.
   - Do not change the backup filename format.
   - Do not change the cron schedule.
   - Do not change the email behavior.
   - Do not modify unrelated code.

4. After the change, the behavior should be:

   - Using the existing `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` (which points to the "daily-db-backups" folder inside the Shared Drive).
   - Service account (already added as Content Manager/Editor to the Shared Drive) can create files successfully.
   - Manual run (`npm run backup:run` or POST /admin/backup/run-now) should:
     - Create and upload `simtree-backup-*.sql.gz` into that folder
     - Insert a SUCCESS row in `backups`
     - Send a success email
   - Retention logic (keeping the latest 14 backups) should work against that same folder using the updated list() call with Shared Drive flags.

5. Keep the changes minimal and clearly scoped to the Drive integration.

Please implement these adjustments now.
