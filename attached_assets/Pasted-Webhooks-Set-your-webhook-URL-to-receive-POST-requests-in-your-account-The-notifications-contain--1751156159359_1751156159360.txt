Webhooks
Set your webhook URL to receive POST requests in your account.
The notifications contain a notifyType field indicating the event category and a content object with specific details. Here are the types you can expect:

ORDER_STATUS

Trigger: Sent when an eSIM is created and ready for retrieval.

Key content field: orderStatus will be "GOT_RESOURCE".

Example Use: Used to know when your eSIM order is ready for download.

SMDP_EVENT

Trigger: Sent during real-time eSIM profile lifecycle events as they occur on the SM-DP+ server.

Key content fields:

eid: eUICC identifier of the device.

iccid: ID of the eSIM.

esimStatus: Current eSIM state (typically GOT_RESOURCE during provisioning, IN_USE when active).

smdpStatus: SM-DP+ server status indicating the specific operation:

DOWNLOAD: eSIM profile is being downloaded to the device.

INSTALLATION: eSIM profile is being installed on the device.

ENABLED: eSIM has been activated/enabled on the device.

DISABLED: eSIM profile has been deactivated/disabled on the device..

DELETED: eSIM profile has been removed from the device.

Example Use: Track real-time eSIM provisioning progress and profile state changes for detailed lifecycle monitoring.

ESIM_STATUS

Trigger: Sent when the status of an individual eSIM changes after it has been allocated. This covers various lifecycle events.

Key content fields:

esimStatus: Indicates the current state. Common values observed include:

IN_USE: The eSIM has been installed/activated on a device.

USED_UP: The eSIM data allowance has been fully consumed.

USED_EXPIRED: The eSIM data is used up, and expired.

UNUSED_EXPIRED: The eSIM expired with data remaining.

CANCEL: The eSIM has been canceled / refunded.

REVOKED: The eSIM profile has been revoked.

smdpStatus: SM-DP+ server status (e.g., ENABLED, DISABLED, RELEASED, DELETED, INSTALLATION).

Example Use: Track activation, data exhaustion, expiration, or cancellations for specific eSIMs and notify customers.

DATA_USAGE

Trigger: Sent when the remaining data allowance on an active eSIM drops below predefined thresholds (e.g., 50%, 20%, 10% ).

Key content fields:

totalVolume: Total data allowance in bytes.

orderUsage: Data used so far in bytes.

remain: Remaining data in bytes.

remainThreshold (optional): May indicate the threshold that triggered the notification (e.g., 0.5 for 50%).

Example Use: Proactively notify end-users about low data balance.

VALIDITY_USAGE

Trigger: Sent when the remaining validity period of an active eSIM reaches 1 day.

Key content fields:

remain: The remaining validity duration (e.g., 1).

durationUnit: The unit for the duration (e.g., "DAY").

expiredTime: The exact timestamp when the eSIM will expire.

totalDuration: The original validity duration.

Example Use: Warn end-users that their plan is about to expire.

Endpoint Setup
Adding your webhook the first time will trigger a test webhook send. If you have a correctly working endpoint, you will receive an CHECK_HEALTH event. If our test send fails, your endpoint cannot be saved.

{"notifyType":"CHECK_HEALTH","content":{"orderNo":"1234567890","orderStatus":"Test"}}

IP Whitelist
For additional security, you can whitelist the following sender IPs:

3.1.131.226

54.254.74.88

18.136.190.97

18.136.60.197

18.136.19.137

Note: The content object structure may vary slightly. Always inspect the received payload to understand all available fields for each notifyType.

Look at our example webhook sending and test trigger form.
